## Development

```

### Using MCP inspector

Load MCP Inspector in your browser:

```bash
npm run test:mcp
```

Open http://localhost:6274/

### Using a real MCP client

To use local stdio MCP server. In your MCP client configuration, use the following:

```json 
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloud-run": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/this/repo/cloud-run-mcp/mcp-server.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To use remote MCP Server in a MCP client:

Start the MCP server locally with:

```bash
npm run start
```

Then, in your MCP client configuration, use the following:

```json 
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloud-run": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:3000/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


## Testing

### To test creating a new project (not using MCP)

See the `test/test-create-project.js` script. Run it with:

```bash
npm run test:create-project
```

This script will guide you through creating a new Google Cloud project and attempting to link it to a billing account. You can optionally provide a desired project ID.

### To test a simple deployment (not using MCP)

See the `test/test-deploy.js` script. Run it with:

```bash
npm run test:deploy
```

This script requires an existing Google Cloud Project ID to be provided when prompted or as a command-line argument.
